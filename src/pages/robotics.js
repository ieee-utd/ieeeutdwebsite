                <p>Take part in our robotics regional! Each year we receive a new problem to solve by IEEE. 
                The competition is based on autonomous robots solving problems. In previous years we built a dual robot system that included 
                a groundbot and a drone designed to navigate a field of cardboard boxes and QR codes. Single aquatic or groundbot based competitions were held as well.
